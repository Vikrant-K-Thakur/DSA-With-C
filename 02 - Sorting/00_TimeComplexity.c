What is Time Complexity?
    Time complexity is a way to describe how the time needed to run an algorithm grows relative to the input size (n).
    It doesn't measure actual time (like seconds).
    Instead, it measures the number of operations or steps.

| Sorting Algorithm | Best Case  | Average Case | Worst Case |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Bubble Sort       | O(n)       | O(n²)        | O(n²)      |
| Insertion Sort    | O(n)       | O(n²)        | O(n²)      |
| Merge Sort        | O(n log n) | O(n log n)   | O(n log n) |
| Quick Sort        | O(n log n) | O(n log n)   | O(n²)      |
| Heap Sort         | O(n log n) | O(n log n)   | O(n log n) |
